# Interview-wiki
A wiki for Software engineers who are preparing for interviews

Usually in a Software Engineer interview, It contains 4 types of rounds:-
- Technical Round where they test you Data structure and algorithm skills
- High Level Design(HLD) round
- Low Level Design(LLD) round
- Behavioural round

Number of rounds for each type would depend on the company which you are applying for. For example Amazon, they usually have 4 rounds in total where first 2 rounds would be related to DS and algorithms. For them, they dont keep a separate round for behavoiural, instead they ask couple of questions in each round.

Every round is important and we should commit time for each. Usually for freshers who are out of college won't be having HLD and LLD rounds. But they can expect OO round instead where they test you Object Oriented skills.

Here in this wiki, I will share all the content which I came across during my interview preparation. I would be sharing courses link, books, git repos which were very useful for me during my preparation. This does not mean you can follow the same preparation for your interviews as everyone has there own style of learning. But you guys can use this wiki as a guide or reference for the preparation. At the end it's your interview.

I will cover each round separately in this wiki. Lets start with Technical round.

## Technical Round

One of the most important rounds for both freshers and experience people. Here they test your knowledge in Data structure and Algorithms. This rounds does not mean that you should well versed with all the different algorithm which exist. But you should atleast have knowledge about the most common one. I have seen people getting very weird and hard problem where they have to implement some rare algorithms. But that is very rare. I won't suggest to spend time there as we should trust the basic probability of facing it. If you want to see the commong interview question pattern you can visit the following link(https://algo.monster/problems/stats)

The things which you should skip are below:
In Datastructure,
Array, Linked List, Stack, Queue, Heap, Map, Set, Trie, Tree, BST
Algorithms
Sorting, Dynamic Programming, Greedy, Searching, Divide and conquer and Graph. If you have time then you can also try Bitwise.

## High Level Design

It means overall archectiture of a system. It includes the description of system architecture, data base design, brief description on systems, services, platforms and relationship among modules. Questions used to be very vague like design Whatspp, Implement Redbus etc. Here you need to come up with a design in less than 30-45 minutes depending on the interviewer. Here interviwer is not expecting you to code but you should be able to design the databases, API etc if asked for.

## Low level Design
It describes detailed description of each and every module means it includes actual logic for every system component and it goes deep into each modules specification. Here you have to code the classes, interfaces etc. You should have very good knowledge of Design patterns. If you know an object oriented language then it would be a plus point.

## Behavioural rounds
I believe here I dont need to give any introduction. This is one of the round where people used to skip but please atleast spent a day and prepare. Most of the interviewers really care about the answer you give in this round. Amazon, google etc. really take this rounds very seriously and you should be aware about what to be prepared and what to be answered for each questions.
