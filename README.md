# Interview-wiki
A wiki for Software engineers who are preparing for interviews

Usually, a Software Engineer Interview has 4 types of rounds:-
- Technical Round
- High Level Design(HLD) Round
- Low Level Design(LLD) Round
- Behavioural Round

The number of rounds for each role would depend on the company which you are applying for. For example Amazon, they usually have 4 rounds in total where the first 2 rounds would be related to Data Structure(DS) and algorithms. For them, they don't keep a separate round for behavioral instead, they ask a couple of questions in each round.

Every round is important and we should commit time to each. Usually, freshers who are out of college won't be having HLD and LLD rounds. But they can expect an OO(Object Oriented) round instead, where they test your Object Oriented skills.

Here in this wiki, I will share all the content which I came across during my interview preparation. I would be sharing courses, books, blogs, and github repos which were very useful for me during my preparation. This does not mean you have to follow the same preparation for your interviews. As everyone has their style of learning. But you can use this wiki as a guide or reference for the preparation. In the end, it's you who is attending the interview.

I will cover each round separately in this wiki. Let us start with the Technical round.

## Technical Round

One of the most important rounds for both freshers and experienced people. Here they test your knowledge of Data structure and Algorithms. These rounds do not test your knowledge of advanced algorithms which exist to solve complex problems. But you should at least know the most common ones. I have seen people getting very weird and rubbish problems that can only be solved with some unique algorithms. But that is very rare. I won't suggest spending time there as we should trust the basic probability of facing it. If you want to see the common interview question pattern you can visit the following website (https://algo.monster/problems/stats)

The things which you should not skip are below:
In Data structure,
Array, Linked List, Stack, Queue, Heap, Map, Set, Trie, Tree, BST
Algorithms
Sorting, Dynamic Programming, Greedy, Searching, Divide and conquer, and Graph algorithms. If you have time then you can also learn Bitwise.

## High-Level Design

It tests your knowledge of designing the overall archectiture of a system. It includes a description of system architecture, database design, and a brief description of systems, services, platforms, and relationships among modules. Questions used to be very vague like design WhatsApp, Implementing Redbus, etc. Here you need to come up with a design in less than 30-45 minutes depending on the interviewer. Here interviewer is not expecting you to code but you should be able to design the databases, API, etc if asked for.

## Low-level Design
It describes a detailed description of every module, which means it includes actual logic for every system component and it goes deep into each module's specification. Here you have to code the classes, interfaces, etc. You should have very good knowledge of Design patterns. If you know an object-oriented language then it would be a plus point.

## Behavioural rounds
I believe here I don't need to give any introduction. This is one of the rounds that people used to skip but in my opinion, spend at least spent a day and prepare. Most of the interviewers care about the answer you give in this round. Amazon, Google, etc. really take these rounds very seriously and you should be aware of what to be prepared for and what to be answered for each question.
